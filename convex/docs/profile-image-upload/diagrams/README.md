# Profile Image Upload - PlantUML Diagrams

This folder contains comprehensive PlantUML diagrams for the profile image upload feature, following the same professional color theme as the main project diagrams.

## Diagram Overview

### 1. **upload-sequence-diagram.puml**
**Complete User Flow Sequence**
- Shows the full user journey from file selection to image display
- Includes all API calls, authentication, and error handling
- Demonstrates the separation between API layer and model layer
- Highlights security checkpoints and performance optimizations

### 2. **architecture-component-diagram.puml**
**System Architecture & Components**
- Visual representation of the layered architecture
- Shows relationships between frontend, API, model, and infrastructure layers
- Includes security and validation components
- Demonstrates data flow and component dependencies

### 3. **error-handling-flow.puml**
**Comprehensive Error Handling Strategy**
- Maps all possible error scenarios and recovery paths
- Shows client-side vs server-side error handling
- Includes authentication, validation, network, and storage errors
- Demonstrates graceful degradation and retry mechanisms

### 4. **state-machine-diagram.puml**
**UI State Machine**
- Complete state management for the upload component
- Shows all UI states from idle to success/error states
- Includes loading states, progress feedback, and transitions
- Covers authentication state handling and error recovery

## Color Theme

All diagrams use the consistent professional light theme:

```puml
' Professional Light Theme Configuration
!$color_bg = "#ffffff"           // Clean white background
!$color_bg_light = "#f8f9fa"     // Light gray for components
!$color_bg_lighter = "#e9ecef"   // Lighter gray for notes
!$color_fg = "#212529"           // Dark text for readability
!$color_primary = "#0066cc"      // Professional blue
!$color_success = "#28a745"      // Success green
!$color_warning = "#856404"      // Warning amber
!$color_error = "#dc3545"        // Error red
!$color_accent = "#6f42c1"       // Purple accent
```

## Diagram Usage

### For Developers
- **Sequence Diagram**: Understand the complete API flow and integration points
- **Architecture Diagram**: See component relationships and responsibilities
- **State Machine**: Implement proper UI state management
- **Error Flow**: Handle all error scenarios gracefully

### For Product/Design
- **Sequence Diagram**: Understand user experience and timing
- **State Machine**: Design appropriate UI feedback and transitions
- **Error Flow**: Plan user-friendly error messages and recovery

### For QA/Testing
- **Error Flow**: Test all error scenarios and edge cases
- **State Machine**: Verify UI state transitions work correctly
- **Sequence Diagram**: Understand integration points for API testing

## Implementation Notes

Each diagram includes detailed implementation notes covering:
- **Security considerations** and authentication requirements
- **Performance optimizations** and best practices
- **User experience** guidelines and feedback patterns
- **Error recovery** strategies and graceful degradation
- **Accessibility** considerations for inclusive design

## Maintenance

When updating the profile image upload feature:
1. **Update relevant diagrams** to reflect code changes
2. **Maintain color consistency** with the established theme
3. **Add implementation notes** for new features or edge cases
4. **Review error handling** to ensure complete coverage

These diagrams serve as living documentation that should evolve with the codebase while maintaining visual consistency across the project.

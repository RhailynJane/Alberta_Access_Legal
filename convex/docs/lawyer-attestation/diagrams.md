# Lawyer Attestation - Visual Diagrams 📊

Think of these diagrams like **maps** that show you how our lawyer ID system works. Just like following directions to get somewhere, these show you the path that data takes through our system! 🗺️

## 0. Schema

## 1. The Complete Journey (Sequence Diagram) 🚗

**How a lawyer goes from "filling out a form" to "having a verified digital ID"**

### What This Means (Like You're 15):

1. **📝 Fill out form**: Lawyer types their name, bar number, and checks boxes
2. **🚀 Hit submit**: Form data flies to our server
3. **🔒 Security check**: "Are you really logged in as a lawyer?"
4. **✅ Validate**: "Does this look like real lawyer data?"
5. **📞 Call LSA**: "Hey Law Society, is lawyer AB12345 legit?"
6. **👍 LSA responds**: "Yep, that's a real lawyer!"
7. **💾 Save it**: Store the attestation in our database
8. **📋 Log it**: Write down "Lawyer X got verified at 2:30pm"
9. **🎉 Celebrate**: Tell the frontend "It worked!"
10. **😊 Happy lawyer**: Show success message

### What This Means (Like You're 15):

- **🌍 Frontend**: The pretty stuff you see (forms, buttons, messages)
- **🌐 API Layer**: The security guard who checks IDs and decides who gets in
- **🧠 Business Logic**: The smart brain that knows the rules and does the work
- **🗄️ Database**: The filing cabinet where we store everything safely

## 3. Error Handling Flow (When Things Go Wrong) 🚨

**Even superheroes have bad days! Here's what happens when something breaks:**

### Error Types & What They Mean:

#### 🔴 **Frontend Errors** (You can fix these!)

- **Empty name**: "Please enter your legal name"
- **Bad bar number**: "Bar number must be 4-10 characters"
- **Unchecked boxes**: "Please confirm all statements"

#### 🟠 **API Errors** (System problems)

- **Not logged in**: "Please sign in to continue"
- **Wrong user type**: "Only lawyers can attest"
- **Network down**: "Connection problem, try again"

#### 🟡 **LSA Errors** (External problems)

- **LSA API down**: "Verification service temporarily unavailable"
- **Invalid bar number**: "Bar number not found in LSA directory"
- **Suspended lawyer**: "Professional standing issues detected"

#### 🔵 **Database Errors** (Rare but possible)

- **Save failed**: "Could not save attestation, please retry"
- **Read failed**: "Could not load your existing data"

## 4. Security & Authentication Flow 🛡️

**Like having bouncers at a VIP club - multiple checkpoints to keep things safe!**

### Security Layers Explained:

1. **🔐 Authentication**: "Who are you?" (Login required)
2. **🎭 Authorization**: "What can you do?" (Role check)
3. **🏠 Ownership**: "Is this yours?" (Data privacy)
4. **✅ Validation**: "Is this data good?" (Quality check)
5. **🏛️ Verification**: "Is this real?" (External validation)
